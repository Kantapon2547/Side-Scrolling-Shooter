# Side-Scrolling Shooter

## Overview

The **Side-Scrolling Shooter** is a 2D action game where players control a heavily armed character through enemy-filled levels. The goal is to eliminate threats, collect power-ups, and survive increasingly difficult challenges. With intuitive controls, fast-paced gameplay, and responsive mechanics, it offers an engaging arcade-style experience.

Players must time their shots, dodge obstacles, and strategically utilize power-ups to defeat waves of enemies and bosses. The game includes a scoring system to encourage replayability and challenge-seeking.

## Concept

The game is built using a modular architecture with object-oriented design principles. Core features include:

- **Smooth movement mechanics** for player and enemies.
- **Responsive shooting controls** with projectile management.
- **Enemy AI** that behaves dynamically with patterns and attack types.
- **Power-up system** that boosts player capabilities (health, damage, speed).
- **Obstacle collision** and hit detection.
- **Scoring and progression system** for tracking performance.
- **Multiple levels** with increasing difficulty and new challenges.

The game is developed using **Python** and **Pygame**, emphasizing performance, clean design, and expandability for future features such as multiplayer or customizable characters.
